> A modern, interactive personal portfolio website showcasing my journey as a Full Stack Developer and CyberSecurity Analyst.

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio is designed to be immersive and thematic. It moves away from standard static templates by incorporating **Canvas Animations** and **Glassmorphism** UI trends. The design philosophy mirrors my interest in the digital matrix—combining clean aesthetic structure with complex underlying logic.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Matrix Digital Rain:** A custom HTML5 Canvas background animation featuring falling green code, paying homage to the CyberSecurity domain.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Translucent, frosted-glass cards and navigation bars using backdrop-filters.
* **Interactive Terminal:** An "About Me" section styled like a command-line interface (CLI).
* **Education Timeline:** A visual timeline displaying my academic journey from IIT Bhilai (M.Tech) to Schooling.
* **Project Showcase:** Highlighted cards for my work in Network Science and SCADA Security.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Desktops, Tablets, and Mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Design:** Custom CSS variables, Google Fonts (Poppins & Fira Code).
* **Animations:** Native HTML5 Canvas API.
